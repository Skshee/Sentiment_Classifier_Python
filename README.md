# Sentiment_Classifier_Python

The Objective of this project is to build a sentiment classfier, which will detect how positive or negative a tweet is.

We have been provided some synthetic (fake, semi-randomly generated) twitter data in a csv file named **project_twitter_data.csv** which has the text of a tweet, the number of retweets of that tweet, and the number of replies to that tweet. We have also words that express positive sentiment and negative sentiment, in the files positive_words.txt and negative_words.txt.

ClassifierResultChart contains the graph of Net score vs Number of Retweets made using Excel's Scatterplot
